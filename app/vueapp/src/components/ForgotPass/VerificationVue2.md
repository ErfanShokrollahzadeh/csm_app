# VerificationVue2.vue

This Vue.js component is used for the "Verification" functionality. It is the page the user is redirected to after successfully entering the OTP in the "Forgot Password" page.

## Data Properties

- `verificationStatus`: This is a boolean that becomes `true` if the verification process is successful.

## Methods

- `verifyUser`: This method is called when the page is loaded. It simulates the process of verifying the user. In a real application, it should send a request to the server to verify the user.

## Styling

- `.verification-success`: This class is added to the verification message if `verificationStatus` is `true`. It styles the message with green text.
- `.verification-failure`: This class is added to the verification message if `verificationStatus` is `false`. It styles the message with red text.

## Usage

To use this component, the user should be redirected to this page after entering the OTP. The `verifyUser` method will be called, and a message will be displayed based on the value of `verificationStatus`.
